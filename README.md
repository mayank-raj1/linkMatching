# Links
Links is a system designed to connect people for walks in Toronto based on what’s on their minds for the week. Using simple and engaging text messages, the platform helps spark meaningful conversations between like-minded individuals.

# 🚀 About the Project
This project was built during the first [🍅Newbuilds Hackathon](https://x.com/newsystems_/status/1828455648377327976?lang=en). It represents a V1 Minimal Lovable Product (MLP) that focuses on simplicity and usability while delivering value to its users.

# 🛠️ How It Works
We used some fancy technologies to bring Links life:

 - **Vector Search:** Matches users based on the semantic similarity of their thoughts and interests.
 - **Search Re-ranking with LLMS:** Fine-tunes the matches for better relevance and user satisfaction.
 - **Reward Distribution Algorithm:** Optimizes the pairing process to ensure fairness and maximize engagement.
